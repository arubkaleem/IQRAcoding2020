<p1><strong><font size="5">Hey everyone! I'm Asfiya and I'm going to tell you all about painting!
That includes all about brushes, techniques, the right paints, and much more!!
I've been doing art and painting since I was 5. I have many experiences with what
materials to use and cool techniques. I'm not very professional, but you could say
I'm pretty good. Let's get painting!</strong></p1>

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
<center><h2><b><font size="7">Supplies</b></21></center>
<p2><strong><font size="5"><br>The first thing to be concerned about painting, is your supplies:
 This includes what paint brushes you use, what paint you use,
and what kind of surface you use. First, let's talk about brushes.</strong></p2>

<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><h0><b><font size="6">BRUSHES</b></h0>
<br><center><img src="brushes.gif"</img></center>
<p0><strong><br><font size="5">It doesn't matter where you buy your brushes 'cause all paint brushes are made with
 almost the same material. Just make sure that when you buy paint brushes that you buy
the ones with good packaging because some paint brushes ruin your painting because its
hairs start falling off. Different types of paint may need different
types of paint brushes, but you can still use normal paint brushes because
it doesn't really make that much of a difference for beginners.
But when you start doing more advanced painting, getting the right brushes is
Important. Brushes with synthetic bristles made from nylon, or nylon and polyester, are best
for water paints. That's because natural-bristle brushes soak up too much water and get
soggy and weak. Use natural-bristle or blended
(natural and synthetic) brushes for oil-based paint.
<br> There are a few basic types of brushes-

<br>=============================================================================
<p00><br>SABLE bristle is soft, holds loads of water and has a great spring making it ideal for watercolour, also
for fine finishing with oils. It returns to its natural point (how it was originally after use.

<br>SQUIRREL is super soft, and holds a lot of water due to the longer length of
squirrel hair, and is great for big watercolor washes. It returns to its natural point when dipped in water.

<br>HOG or PIG bristle is a stiff bristle, and holds little moisture but has strength and sturdiness.
It’s great to use in oil painting and also great for moving thick paint
around the canvas. These are generally used with oil paints, and they tend to have long handles allowing you to
work upright at an easel.
They can be used with acrylic but don't let them soak in water.</p00>
<br>=============================================================================

<br> Again, the brush you chose doesn't really matter. Most brushes are the same. You just need
to remember to use the thinner brushes for more detail, and thicker and bigger brushes for bigger work.
So you won’t need to worry much about them, sure you need them, but almost any type will work!</strong></p0>

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<p2><strong><br>Next thing you need to think about, the MOST important thing,
is your paints.</strong></p2>

<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h3><b><font size="6">PAINT</b></h3>
<p3><strong><font size="5">The most important of the supplies for painting is (obviously) paint.
You need to have the right kind of paint for painting, otherwise, your painting will turn into a
painting with different textures, and weird consistency, which can look exotic for paintings, like abstract paintings,
but usually isn't good to have. First of all, there are 5 types of paints;</strong></p3>

<ul>

<p4><strong><li>Acrylic</li></p4>
<p5><li>Watercolor</li></p5>
<p6><li>Oil paint</li></p6>
<p3> - are the most common.</p3>
<p3><br>For more advance work there is also</p3>
<p7><li>Gouache</li></p7>
<p8><li>and Encaustic paints</li></p8>

</ul>

<br>=============================================================================
<ul>

<p4><font size="5"><li>Acrylic paints are smooth and light and have excellent pigment quality,
color strength, and durability. It can stick to almost any stable surface like
watercolor paper or canvas. It dries quickly and you can buy it in the form of a tube or as an ink-bottle.
Also, if you ever see paint labeled tempera paint, it is basically the same
with a few differences.</li><strong></p4>

<br><p5><font size="5"><li> Watercolor is a bit translucent because when you paint with it, you usually
mix it with water or it is either ALREADY mixed with water, to give your painting a
blended look. The paint stays together and it doesn't flake. The paint has color pigment
which is kind of transparent because of the water mixed in the paint.</li></p5>

<br><p6><font size="5"><li>Oil-based paint is very durable and gives a glossy-looking finish.
The paint is smooth and gives good varnish, Oil-based paint has long-lasting coverage
and blends well with others. This paint dries slowly which is good for painters, so they can work gradually,
making changes along the way, but it can be a disadvantage sometimes.</li> </p6>

<br><p7><font size="5"><li>Gouache is a type of watercolor paint. It is able to be dissolved in water
and it's an opaque paint so the color of the surface of the paper or canvas you are using does not show through.
It's a bit chalkier than traditional watercolor. The paint is a bit weak due to the water mixed in it, but it
has a strong colored pigment. Gouache paint dries a bit darker than the original color and it takes time to
dry which means you can still work with the paint, for hours or even days after putting
on a surface.</li></p7>

<br><p8><font size="5"><li> Encaustic is wax-based with a strong color pigment.
It is a flexible paint choice and doesn't attach to moisture. It is very durable and best on a firm,
absorbent surface. Basically it's melted beeswax, with pigments added to it.</li></p8>

</ul>
<br>=============================================================================

<br><p3><font size="5"> There are many different varieties of paint out there.When it comes to choosing paint,
you can select a paint based on the style and finish. You can find a unique
paint you like, due to all the possibilities! I personally think the oil, acrylic, and watercolor paints,
work the best for beginners and are usually cheap too. I have not tried Gouache and Encaustic
paint before, but I am sure it will be a great experience trying them!</p3>

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<p2><br>You also need to look for the correct surface for each paint. Sure you CAN paint on plain
paper put it can bleed through since it is not really made for painting. Here is what to
use for what paint!</p2>

<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><h9><b><font size="6">SURFACE</b></h9>
<br><p9><font size="5">Your choice of what you paint on, can turn out different than how you
want it to be depending on the surface you choose. Here are a few tips you can use to help you find the right
surface!!!.</p9>

<br>=============================================================================
<br><p4><font size="5">-Acrylics straight from the tube is VERY flexible, making
the paint able to stick on any surface;  from paper, canvas, cardboard, to metal metal.
Acrylics are mostly used on canvas though.</p4>

<br><p5><font size="5">-For water color paint, watercolor paper is best.
Good watercolor paper is versatile, strong and helps to blend your colors when painting.
You can also use watercolor paint on canvas too!</p4>

<br><p6><font size="5">-Oil paints are more tricky, these have to be painted onto a properly prepared surface
like a prepared canvas or prepared board. A clean hard surface is good, to help it to not flow because
oil paints do tend to flow.</p4>

<br><p7><font size="5">-Gouache can be used on a variety of surfaces. It is usually used on heavy paper such
as watercolor paper or Bristol paper. You can also use it on canvas.</p4>
<br><p8><font size="5">-Since Encaustic paint is basically, melted beeswax, it's usually used on a surface
that is hard, and stiff. For example, it can be used on surfaces like
prepared wood, sturdy canvas and other stiff surfaces.</p4>
<br>=============================================================================

<br><p9><font size="5">Although most of these paints, work best on their specific surfaces,
You can use almost all of these on canvas, which are cheap and easy to get. You can get canvases
different sizes and styles, so you can pick with a unique canvas is best for your painting!</p9>

<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p2><br>There are also other materials for painting that I didn't mention, like a palette, a palette knife,
 a painting easel, etc. because these are basically self-explanatory. The supplies I talked about are the basics;
the must-have in painting. You can get a lot of these things at your local arts/hardware supplies store
like at Micheals, Home Depot, and Hobby Lobby, or online. Here a few
websites you can buy your supplies at -

<center><h10><b><font size="7">Techniques!</b></h10></center>
<br><p10><font size="5"> When painting, there are many techniques you can choose from!! Most of these work BEST
with Acrylic paints. Let me share a few basic ones with you!!</p10>

<br>=============================================================================
<br><h11><b><font size="6">DRYBRUSH</b></h11>
<br><p11><font size="5">When you apply acrylic paint straight out of the tube to a canvas using a dry brush,
you can create a strong stroke of color on the page. Your lines will be uneven (because there's no water to soften
the edges). You'll want to use this method when you can sharp strokes, since you can blend the colors!</p11>

<br><h11><b><font size="6">WASHING</b></h11>
<br><p11><font size="5">If you add enough water to it, acrylic acts a bit like watercolor ! You can use this paint to
apply translucent washes on your surface. But unlike watercolor, the acrylic paint will set. But you can add water to
your brush and rub it on the paint to soften it a bit. Although it is still best to use watercolor for blendings!</p11>

<br><h11><b><font size="6">SPLATTER EFFECT</b></h11>
<br><p11><font size="5">Honestly, this is one of THE most fun techniques! Using a brush that is a bit wet and has paint
on it, you can flick or splatter paint onto a work surface for an uneven splatter effect. It looks aming for a small
finish too. Just note that the first few flicks, the paint comes in bigger blobs. If you flick it on another paper
first, then flick it onto your canvas, you get smaller splatters!</p11>

<br><h11><b><font size="6">DABBING</b></h11>
<br><p11><font size="5">You can make an excellent effect by using the Dabbing technique. If you put paint on
a sponge and dab it on the surface, you get a very unique effect, that you can achieve with brushes.
This can be used with any paint, although watercolor doesn't work well because it is flowier. If you don't have a
sponge handy, you can scrunch up a paper towel, and do the same thing! I tried it once, and it didn't
look half bad!</p11>

<br><h11><b><font size="6">USING A PALETTE KNIFE</b></h11>
<br><p11><font size="5">Applying paint with a palette knife is an instant way to make your work look painterly.
And since it's no different from spreading frosting on a cake, beginners can do it too! You just need to take the
palette knife to scrape up a bit of paint and apply it to your work surface. You'll get the hang of it
pretty quickly. When you apply it first, you get a cool, effect that is thicker on the edges, and thinner in
middle, you can leave it like this to give a cool effect, or spread out evenly.
<br><center><img src="giphy.gif"</img></center></p11>

<br><h11><b><font size="6">MIX AND MATCH</b></h11>
<br><p11><font size="5">You can also unevenly mix colors, and paint with them, making a mix-color effect. This technique
 is great for abstract art and makes a REALLY cool effect!! And it's a great painting experience for beginners!
You can also fully mix colors, to make a whole different color! There is much you can experiment with paint.</p11>

<br><h11><b><font size="6">FLUID ART</b></h11>
<br><p11><font size="5"> Whether you want to call it fluid art, liquid art, or acrylic pouring, there’s nothing more
satisfying than creating abstract masterpieces by letting paint run.
This form of abstract art uses acrylics with a runny consistency to create
paintings. You take the paint and pour it onto the surface of your canvas, anyway you like.
There are endless creative possibilities to spill it. You can watch tutorials on how to get started
to do fluid art, on YouTube!</p11>

<br><h11><b><font size="6">FINGER PAINTING</b></h11>
<br><p11><font size="5">Although it seems like a 2 year old non-mature, way of painting, finger painting
is a great technique! You can make various different looks, that you can’t make with just about any other tool.
And it is a lot easier to control the paint, since you are using your finger, which helps a LOT!

<br>=============================================================================
<br><p10><font size="5"> The techniques I mentioned are just a few basic ones, there are many techniques out there that
you can use. You can even create your own style and textures for painting, and create your own unique techniques!

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<br><p12>While it's worth giving these techniques, different materials, and brushes a shot, don't limit yourself to the
basics. Mix and match methods, techniques, and materials, exploring the ways of painting that feel right to you.
As you explore your skills, you'll notice that your work will have their own unique way of art.
Honestly, you just have to start, and let your creativity grow!! And if you need help, there are many
tutorials, and videos, you can use for help, and to get ideas! And don't stress while painting, let your
hands do the work and relax. Sometimes it may seem like your work if horrible, I felt like that MANY times,
but you just have to keep trying, and practice to achieve it. And don't worry if it doesn't seem to work out because
"Every artist was once an amateur". All you need to do is BEGIN.</strong></p12>
